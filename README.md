This is the website for Barbary Coast Books. It's a single page serverless website, served via github.
There is literally nothing to see here that would be unavaiable on www.barbarycoastbooks.com.
If you'd like to learn how to do this, I can point you at Google.com and tell you to search for "Jamstack".
